					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>Buildium's suite of communication workflows were inconsistent and didn't match a user's mental model for online communication patterns. This led to a higher margin of error, more time on task, and a general lack of confidence when property managers communicated with their customers.</p>
					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>Craft a system of reusable UI components that can be shared between Buildium communication workflows, creating a cohesive experience across the application that feels intuitive and familiar to a user.</p>

					<h2>Legacy State<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>Buildium's legacy message composition workflows were long, convoluted forms. These experiences resulted in unnecessary scrolling, significant cognitive load, and conflicted with well-known conventions. The experiences for “Composing an email,” “Creating a mailing,” and “Sending a bulk text message” varied significantly. They offered little guidance for designers and engineers and didn't align with the company's communication vision.</p>

					<h2>Building Blocks<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>Responsiveness is key to building a great reputation as a property manager. On any given day, they communicate with residents, applicants, rental owners, and vendors through a variety of mediums—texts, phone calls, legal notices, and more.</p>
					<p>Whether the message is a one-on-one conversation or an announcement meant for entire properties, it needs to thoughtfully-constructed, easily pulled together, and sent with haste.</p>
					<h3>Adding recipients</h3>
					<p>In order for any piece of writing to be effective, it needs to be tailored to suit its audience. That’s why it’s vital to have a clear and easy way of choosing recipients when crafting a message.</p>

					<h3>WYSIWYG Editor</h3>
					<p>One-size-fits-all communication isn’t possible. Inevitably, there will be times when users must customize a message’s contents. From adjusting font size and text styling, to attaching images and files, users need an intuitive way to make sure their message fulfills their specific needs.</p>
					<img class="lg" src="../assets/images/projects/comms-ui_wysiwyg-editor.jpg">
					<h3>Adding attachments</h3>
					<p>Attachments, like signed lease agreements or images of property damages, play an important part of the communication process. Our legacy solution only allowed a single file to get attached which caused workarounds, headaches, and user frustration. Our new solution needed to be more flexible and allow for multiple files in each message.</p>

					<h2>Putting It Together<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>Pulling together the above components and interactions (and many more that aren’t detailed) resulted in a whole that was larger than the sum of its parts. When combined, they created a communication experience that felt familiar and easy to use.</p>

					<h2>A Scalable Design<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>By establishing a framework powered by reusable components, we were able to bring the experiences for writing emails, text messages, and more into harmony with one another. The design system approach also allowed us to build future experiences more quickly and leverage users’ prior understanding to help with adoption.</p>
