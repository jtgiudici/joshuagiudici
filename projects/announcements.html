					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>Property managers are often faced with calamity; water leaks, elevator maintenance, missing cats, and more. During urgent situations, they need to reach residents in a timely, efficient way&ndash;and ensure their important messages are actually read.</p>
					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>Design a feature that allows property managers to write a message once and blast it across three different communication channels for maximum visibility.</p>

					<h2>Discovery<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>This project came to our team via feedback from our customer-facing teams. Users were requesting a "Mass texting feature" for communicating with residents. We decided it would be a good idea to connect with customers first, before launching into a solution based on that request.</p>
					<h3>Talking to customers</h3>
					<p>Working with my product owner, we crafted a call script that started at a high level to better understand our customer's experience communicating with residents. We then slowly narrowed in on the concept of "mass texting" to see where their pain points resided.</p>
					<p>Communicating urgent messages with residents at entire properties was one of our user's biggest issues. Messages for things like water shutoffs and scheduled maintenance, needed to be read in advance by a resident to prevent a complaint or phone call to their property manager later on. Meanwhile, messages about upcoming inclement weather can ensure the safety of residents. Both messages are urgent and need to be read immediately. However, property managers only had email at their disposal for communicating en masse, which couldn't guarantee prompt readership from all residents.</p>
					<!-- <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
					<p>Property managers were facing issues communicating on a large scale to their residents. While initial asks were around bulk texting, this alone wouldn't solve the problem. Some residents were texting one on one with their property managers, while others relied on email as a primary communication channel. We defined a higher level problem statement that took everything into account:</p>
					<p class="callout">Property managers aren't able to communicate urgent messages that require action or up front notice to residents on the most effective communication channels to ensure that the message is received in a prompt manner.</p>
					<p>With a problem statement in hand, we were ready to start ideating on a solution.</p> -->

					<h3>Our friend the whiteboard</h3>
					<p>In order to wrap our heads around these problems, my product owner and I picked up Expo markers and headed to the nearest whiteboard to brainstorm solutions. Several coffees and many hand cramps later, we found a promising path forward: a messaging platform that would send one message via 3 channels (email, text messaging, and post to a resident's portal account).</p>

					<h3>Lofi designing</h3>
					<p>Now that we were further down the path on our ideation and whiteboarding sessions, we had a good sense of what our solution would be like. From there, I took those ideas and continued to refine them from paper sketches into a low fidelity mockup in Sketch that was turned into an Invision prototype that we could test with our users.</p>
					<!-- <img class="med" src="" style="padding-bottom: 33.333334%; background-color: #aeaeae;">
					<img class="med" src="" style="padding-bottom: 33.333334%; background-color: #aeaeae;"> -->
					<h3>Usability testing</h3>
					<p>We tested our initial prototypes to positive results from both a usability and concept standpoint. Customers were excited about the prospect of sending out message blasts across multiple channels. However, we were learning that these messages needed to be short. Shorter messages were more likely to be read than the long paragraphs found in a standard email. Also, since these messages would be received via text messages, long paragraphs in a text thread would annoy residents to the point of opting themselves out of texting.</p>
					<h3>Introducing "Announcements"</h3>
					<p>Ultimately, we landed on optimizing the experience around the texting experience. Messages that were optimized for texting provided the best route to get messages read by residents. Shorter messages would also translate easier to our two other channels, Email and Resident Center posts, than longer messages would translate to texting.</p>
					<p>Our solution, which we'd release initially as an opt-in beta, would be a feature called "Announcements" that would allow property managers to send one message via 3 channels (email, text messaging, and post to a resident's portal account). Property managers would be able to write messages up to 140 characters that would be read quickly and comfortably on all channels.</p>

					<h2>Beta Release<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>We released "Announcements" as an opt-in beta to gauge feedback before a wider release to our entire customer base.</p>
					<h3>Surveying beta users</h3>
					<p>A survey was launched in tandem with the Announcements beta. The responses were still largely positive overall, however there were quite a few responses that users wanted the ability to write longer messages.</p>
					<h3>Following up with customers</h3>
					<p>We reached out to customers who had used the beta to get a better sense of what was and wasn't working. While their primary use cases were urgent messages (weather warnings, water shut offs, etc. ), there were also less urgent scenarios where they'd want to have messages go out via multiple channels (newsletters, upcoming events). These types of messages were typically longer in length and while customers admitted that they didn't want residents to receive them via text message, there was value in them being shared to the Resident Center and via email.</p>
					<h3>Further design refinement</h3>
					<p>Based on feedback from the beta, we refined  "Announcements" and gave users the freedom to write both longer and shorter messages. If users wrote under 140 characters, the message would send via all 3 channels (text, email, Resident Center post). However, if their message went over 140 characters the message would only deliver via email and post to the Resident Center.</p>

					<h2>Final Design<span class="border"></span></h2>
					<p>Our final design was a delivery of a new messaging feature in Buildium's property management application, called "Announcements. It allowed property managers to quickly and easily send urgent messages to their residents via three communication channels: Email, text message, and post to their Resident Center account. Sending out these messages via three channels ensured that urgent messages, such as freeze warnings and water shutoffs, were received promptly by residents on multiple communication channels. This ensured residents could read the message in a prompt manner, take action quickly, or be notified up front of important information. Our design was also built to be flexible enough to accommodate longer messages that would only go out via email and post to the Resident Center, to keep residents informed about more informal messages.</p>

					<h3>Feature onboarding</h3>
					<p>Working closely with a UX copywriter we crafted a new "Introductory modal" experience that enticed users to adopt a feature on their first visit. The experience included four steps, each showcasing a hand-crafted illustration and copy outlining a value prop to the user.</p>
					<img class="lg" src="../assets/images/projects/announcements_final-deisgn_intro-modal-01.png">
					<img class="sm" src="../assets/images/projects/announcements_final-deisgn_intro-modal-02.png">

					<img class="sm" src="../assets/images/projects/announcements_final-deisgn_intro-modal-04.png">

					<h3>Scalable compose message experience</h3>
					<p>A new pattern for composing messages that matched a user's mental model for sending a message on the web. The components were intentionally designed and scalable to future "Compose message" experiences, such as email and bulk texting.</p>
					<img class="lg" src="../assets/images/projects/announcements_final-deisgn_compose-modal.png">

					<h3>Templates that promote good writing</h3>
					<p>Providing a set of prewritten templates around the common use cases we knew about helped take the headache out of property managers being able to write short messages. Having these templates handy educated users on what a well-written message, under 140 characters, should look like.</p>
					<img class="lg" src="../assets/images/projects/announcements_final-deisgn_templates-dropdown.png">

					<h3>A flexible message crafting experience</h3>
					<p>Flexibility is valuable, but getting messages read is paramount. Our experience enabled users to write messages longer than 140 characters, but it was important that users knew the impact of their action. Messages sent as text had a higher likelihood of being read, so users were alerted the moment they went over 140 characters and would miss out on texting.</p>

					<img class="med" src="../assets/images/projects/announcements_final-deisgn_message-under-140.png">

					<h3>Confirmation page that reinforces confidence</h3>
					<p>Sending a message to hundreds of recipients can be overwhelming. Giving users a confirmation page gave them a safety net to check how their message would be displayed across each medium and ensure that they were ready to take a decisive action.</p>
